    "## Stepwise Backward Elimination (Wrapper Method)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stepwise Backward Elimination** is a _wrapper-based_, _greedy_ feature selection algorithm.  \n",
    "It starts with **all available features** and removes them **one at a time** based on their impact on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin with the full model and iteratively **remove the least useful feature** at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm is **sequential**, not exhaustive.\n",
    "- It evaluates the effect of **removing one feature at a time**.\n",
    "- Once a feature is removed, it **cannot be added back**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with all features**  \n",
    "   Fit the model using the complete feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluate feature removal**  \n",
    "   For each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporarily remove that feature\n",
    "- Fit the model with the remaining features\n",
    "- Evaluate performance (e.g., RMSE, accuracy, ROC AUC, cross-validation score)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remove the worst feature**  \n",
    "   Permanently remove the feature whose removal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improves performance the most, or\n",
    "- Degrades performance the least\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat**  \n",
    "   Continue removing features until:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A desired number of features is reached, or\n",
    "- Performance drops beyond a threshold, or\n",

    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have features: **A, B, C, D**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 0:** Start with `{A, B, C, D}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Try removing each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove A → `{B, C, D}` → score = 0.82\n",
    "- Remove B → `{A, C, D}` → score = 0.78\n",
    "- Remove C → `{A, B, D}` → score = 0.81\n",
    "- Remove D → `{A, B, C}` → score = 0.84 ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "➡ Remove **D** permanently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Current set `{A, B, C}`  \n",
    "Try removing one more:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove A → `{B, C}` → score = 0.80\n",
    "- Remove B → `{A, C}` → score = 0.75\n",
    "- Remove C → `{A, B}` → score = 0.83 ✅\n",

    "### Important Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does **not** evaluate all feature combinations\n",
    "- Computationally cheaper than exhaustive search\n",

    "The difference between the R² scores obtained using all features (R² ≈ 0.47) and using the selected features (R² ≈ 0.44) is negligible. This indicates that, after feature selection, the predictive performance of the model remains largely unchanged. In other words, we were able to reduce the input dimensionality to only two features while sacrificing only a very small amount of predictive accuracy. This reduction leads to simpler models, improved interpretability, and lower computational cost during both training and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, the absolute value of the R² score should be interpreted relatively rather than in isolation. An R² in the range of 0.4–0.5 does not necessarily indicate weak performance. In many real-world regression problems, a substantial portion of the variance in the target variable is driven by unobserved factors, measurement noise, or inherently stochastic processes. As a result, even well-performing models may explain only a moderate fraction of the total variance.\n"
