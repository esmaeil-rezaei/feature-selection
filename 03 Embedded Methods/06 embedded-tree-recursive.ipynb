    "## Recursive Feature Selection with Tree-Based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The **recursive feature selection** workflow for tree-based models works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fit a tree-based model** on the dataset (e.g., Random Forest).\n",
    "2. **Rank features** by importance (using `feature_importances_`).\n",
    "3. **Remove the least important feature(s)**.\n",
    "4. **Refit the model** on the remaining features.\n",
    "5. **Repeat steps 2–4** until the desired number of features is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This process is \"recursive\" because features are **iteratively eliminated** based on their contribution to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **scikit-learn**, you can use **RFE** with a tree-based estimator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n",
    "rfe = RFE(estimator=rf, n_features_to_select=10, step=1)\n",
    "rfe.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "selected_features = X_train.columns[rfe.support_]\n",
    "print(\"Selected features:\", selected_features.tolist())\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also use `SequentialFeatureSelector` and set the `direction` to `backward`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_selection import SequentialFeatureSelector\n",
    "\n",
    "rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "sfs = SequentialFeatureSelector(\n",
    "    rf,\n",
    "    n_features_to_select=10,\n",
    "    direction='backward',\n",
    "    scoring='accuracy',\n",
    "    cv=5\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "sfs.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "selected_features = X_train.columns[sfs.get_support()]\n",
    "print(\"Selected features:\", selected_features.tolist())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Without recursion, if you remove multiple features at once based on importance, you risk discarding features that may still be valuable **in combination with others**. Recursive elimination avoids this by removing **one (or a few) feature(s) at a time**, allowing the model to adjust and preserve important interactions.\n"
