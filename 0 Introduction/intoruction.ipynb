    "### What is feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of choosing a subset of relevant input variables (features) from the original set, while discarding irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features, without transforming the features themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature selection vs feature engineering vs feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In feature selection, we select columns without changing their values. The goal is to identify features that are not redundant and not noise, and to remove those that do not contribute meaningful information to the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we use different techniques, such as LASSO, where features with zero (or near-zero) coefficients are removed. Importantly, the original feature values remain unchanged; we only decide whether a column is kept or discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "By removing features, dimensionality is reduced, but dimensionality reduction is not the primary goal. The reduction may be small (removing one or two variables) or large (removing many variables), depending on the data. The main objective is relevance and non-redundancy, not compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In feature extraction, we transform the data into a new feature space. Methods such as PCA and SVD are used to reshape the original variables into new features that better explain the structure or variance of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are explicit dimensionality reduction algorithms. The resulting features are combinations of the original variables, and therefore feature values change, and the original columns are no longer preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, dimensionality reduction methods are a subset of feature extraction methods, where the objective is to represent the data using fewer, transformed variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In feature engineering, we create new variables that did not originally exist in the dataset, typically using domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given weight and height, we can create BMI as a new variable. These engineered features may improve model performance or interpretability and can coexist with the original features.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of variables (dimensions) in a dataset by transforming the data into a lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to reduce the dimension itself, typically to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- lower computational cost,\n",
    "\n",
    "- mitigate the curse of dimensionality,\n",
    "\n",
    "- remove noise,\n",
    "\n",
    "- enable visualization or faster learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, dimensionality reduction methods change the feature values by constructing new variables that summarize or combine the original ones. As a result, the original features are not preserved.\n"

    "#### Why feature selection is needed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improves generalization\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
