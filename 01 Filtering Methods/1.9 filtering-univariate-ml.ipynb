    "#### Model-based univariate feature evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to statistical filter methods (such as ANOVA or mutual information), there is another group of feature selection approaches that rely on **predictive modeling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, each feature is evaluated **independently by fitting** a predictive model between that single feature and the target variable. The choice of the machine learning model is flexible and depends on the problem; it can be a linear model, logistic regression, tree-based model, or any other estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select one feature at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train a predictive model using only that feature as input and the target variable as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the model using an appropriate performance metric, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - AUC or ROC-AUC for classification problems\n",
    "\n",
    "  - RMSE, MAE, or R2 for regression problems\n",
    "\n",
    "  - p-values or likelihood-based metrics in statistical settings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeat this process for all features in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating all features individually, the resulting performance metrics are collected and ranked. Features that achieve higher predictive performance are considered more informative with respect to the target. Finally, the top n features—those with the best performance scores—are selected.\n",
